A wrapper of all Esrol server components for creating performance efficient, well structured (by following "convention over configuration" approach), but also configurable, server-side applications.

Esrol as a component is responsible for installing the server app and its dependencies.


The [Wiki](https://github.com/esrol/esrol-server-app/wiki) contains information about installation and API documentation.
